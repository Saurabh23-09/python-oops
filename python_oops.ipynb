These objects are like containers that hold both data (called attributes or properties) and the code that operates on that data (called methods or functions). -->\n",

        "    \n",
        "     * <!--  In OOP, a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines the structure and behavior of objects, including their attributes (data) and methods (functions). -->\n",

        "   * <!-- In OOP, an object is an instance of a class. It's a concrete realization of the blueprint defined by the class. Objects have their own unique set of attributes (data) and can perform actions defined by their methods (functions). -->\n",

        "Goal:\n",
        " Simplify complexity by providing a high-level interface to interact with objects, without needing to understand the internal workings.\n",
        "Analogy:\n",
        " Think of a TV remote. You use the buttons to change channels, adjust volume, etc., without knowing the intricate electronics inside the remote or the TV. The remote abstracts the complexity.\n",

        " Q7- What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "   * <!-- Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" is a concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This means that you can use a single interface to interact with objects of various classes, and they will respond differently based on their individual implementations. -->\n",
        " Q8- How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "    * <!-- Encapsulation in Python is achieved through conventions and programming practices rather than enforced access modifiers like in some other languages (e.g., Java). Python follows the principle of \"we're all consenting adults here,\" meaning it relies on developers to respect the intended usage of class members. -->\n",

        " Q9- What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "    * <!-- In Python, a constructor is a special method within a class that is automatically called when an object of that class is created. It's used to initialize the object's attributes with initial values, set up any necessary resources, and prepare the object for use. -->\n",

        " Q11-What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "   * <!-- Method overloading is the ability to define multiple methods in a class with the same name but with different parameters. This allows you to provide different implementations of the same method, tailored to different input types or numbers of arguments. -->\n",
        "\n",
        " Q12-What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "   * <!-- Method overriding is a language feature that allows a subclass or child class to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already provided by one of its superclasses or parent classes. -->\n",

        " Q13-What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "   * <!-- The @property decorator in Python is a powerful tool that allows you to define methods that act like attributes. Essentially, it lets you access methods as if they were attributes, without needing to write parentheses. -->\n",

        " Q14-Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  * <!-- Polymorphism, meaning \"many forms,\" is a crucial concept in OOP that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type. This has several significant benefits that make it essential for writing flexible, maintainable, and extensible code.\n",
        "\n",
        " Here are some key reasons why polymorphism is important in OOP:\n",
        "\n",
        " * Flexibility and Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism allows you to write code that can work with objects of various types without needing to know their specific class. This makes your code more flexible and reusable because it can adapt to different scenarios.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example,\n",
        "  you could write a function to calculate the area of a shape, and it would work with objects representing circles, squares, triangles, etc., as long as they all have an area() method.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Extensibility and Maintainability:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism makes it easier to extend your code with new functionality without modifying existing code. You can simply create new classes that implement the common interface and integrate them seamlessly into your existing system.\n",
        "\n",
        "  This reduces the risk of introducing bugs and makes your code more maintainable over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Loose Coupling:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism promotes loose coupling between different parts of your code. This means that changes in one part of the system are less likely to affect other parts, making your code more robust and easier to evolve.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Code Organization and Readability:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism allows you to organize your code into a hierarchy of classes, where subclasses inherit and specialize the behavior of their superclasses. This can make your code more structured and easier to\n",
        "  understand.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Supporting Design Patterns:\n",
        "\n",
        "  Polymorphism is a fundamental building block for many design patterns, such as the Strategy pattern, the Template Method pattern, and the Factory pattern. These patterns provide solutions to common software design problems and can significantly improve the quality of your code. -->\n",
        "\n",
        " Q15-What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "    * <!-- In Python, an abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It serves as a blueprint for other classes (called concrete classes) and defines a common interface that its subclasses must implement -->\n",

        "  * <!-- OOP offers several benefits that make it a popular and powerful programming paradigm:\n",
        "\n",
        "Modularity and Reusability:\n",
        "\n",
        " OOP allows you to break down complex problems into smaller, more manageable modules (classes and objects). These modules can be reused in different parts of your program or even in other projects, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.\n",
        "\n",
        "Data Encapsulation and Security:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Encapsulation protects data integrity by bundling it with the methods that operate on it. This prevents unintended access or modification of data from outside the object, enhancing security and reducing the risk of errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "Abstraction and Simplicity:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Abstraction hides complex implementation details and presents a simplified interface to the user. This makes code easier to understand and use, as you don't need to know the inner workings of an object to interact with it.\n",
        "\n",
        "Flexibility and Maintainability:\n",
        "\n",
        "  OOP allows you to easily modify and extend your code without affecting other parts of the system. Changes to one class or object are localized and don't ripple through the entire program, making maintenance easier and reducing the risk of introducing bugs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Code Organization and Structure:\n",
        "\n",
        "  OOP provides a clear and structured way to organize your code into classes and objects, improving readability and making it easier to navigate and understand complex systems.\n",
